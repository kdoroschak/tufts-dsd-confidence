README: generateOrderedWeightMatrix.py

Transforms a list of weights into a matrix of weights. Order is specified by a protein list. Directedness is not conserved, i.e. the weight at AB will be inserted at AB and BA.

usage: generateOrderedWeightMatrix.py [-h] -o O -i I -p P

Build a matrix of weights from an input protein list and a specified order.
Weights are inserted as-is, with no modifications other than position.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -o O        name of the output weight matrix file (tab-delimited 2D matrix)
  -i I        name of PPI input file. must be tab-delimited, fully connected,
              and have confidence score as 3rd column
  -p P        name of the ordered list of proteins, for ordering the matrix
