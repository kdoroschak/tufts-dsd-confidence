README: compareTwoDsds.py

Primitively compare two DSDs to illuminate how and where the DSD changed. Comparisons include things like the difference in overall average between the two, The number of positions that increased and decreased, etc. If desired, you may include two proteins and an adjacency matrix to investigate the change in an edge's neighborhood between two DSD runs.

usage: compareTwoDsds.py [-h] --originalDsd ORIGINALDSD --newDsd NEWDSD -o
                         OUTFILE [-a ADJMATRIX ADJMATRIX]
                         [-p PROTEINS PROTEINS]

Compare two individual DSDs to illuminate how and where the DSD changed.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --originalDsd ORIGINALDSD
                        DSD to use as a baseline for comparisons with the new
                        DSD.
  --newDsd NEWDSD       DSD to compare against the original DSD.
  -o OUTFILE, --outFile OUTFILE
                        Output file to store text-based results of
                        comparisons.
  -a ADJMATRIX ADJMATRIX, --adjMatrix ADJMATRIX ADJMATRIX
                        Adjacency matrix and its specified order to determine
                        neighbors for more detailed comparisons. If this arg
                        is not provided, these comparisons will not be done.
                        Same format as DSD. Specify matrix as first arg and
                        its corresponding ordered list of proteins as the
                        second.
  -p PROTEINS PROTEINS, --proteins PROTEINS PROTEINS
                        Edge eliminated in the new DSD. Will be used for
                        neighborhood calculations. If not provided, these
                        comparisons will not be done.
