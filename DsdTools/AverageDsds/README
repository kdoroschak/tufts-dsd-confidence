README: AverageDsds directory

This directory contains all scripts for averaging DSDs in list or matrix format.

DsdAverage-list.py
DsdAverage-matrix.py
module_*.py

To average 2+ LIST DSDs, use DsdAverage-list.py.

To average 2+ MATRIX DSDs, use DsdAverage-matrix.py PLUS the desired module.
Modules contain the code that does the actual averaging, so the method can be easily and quickly swapped out, changed, or added.

Both the list and matrix version require all of the DSDs-to-be-averaged to be placed in a single directory with nothing else.

For the matrix version, you'll also need to point to a DSD that contains all the proteins included in any the DSDs-to-be-averaged.
