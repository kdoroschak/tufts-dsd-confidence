DSD-transition
--------------
Mengfei's thing. Has been changed so it can use a transition matrix.

Out of sync. Two different versions floating around.


DsdTools
--------
  Transition matrix format: edge edge transition_score

  DsdAverage - Higher-order. Uses other modules in directory to change 
               behavior.
  CompareDsds - A visualization tool.
  GenerateRandomProteinIndices - Annotation file as input.
                                 Produces something for majority vote?
  GenerateWeightMatrix - Takes a PPI with confidence and produces weights.
  script_runners/DsdRunner.sh - Batch run DSD computations.
  GOSemSimRunner.R - Not really used?
  MajorityVoteIterative - Modified Mengfei's code
                          Requires a bit of setup with files in the
                          right place. See the docs in that directory.
  NetworkGenerator - Used to run "100 dsds"?
                     Specify number of networks with confidence file,
                     and determine probability that an edge exists as output.
  file_reformatting - Junk directory. Extracting low confidence edges? Here!
  run_mv - Runs majority vote from varying starting points.
           Recomputes intermediate files if they aren't passed.
  weight_by_lit - Assigning weights by publications.


Data
----
Biogrid data are the crown jewels.
    Biogrid directory contains data for different iterations using different
    confidences. README has been promised.

    biogrid_mv_reusable - Important. Has original full and connected PPI.
                          Annotations and adjacency matrix.
                          Reusable for pretty much everything?

    biogrid_original - Biogrid data without confidence.
                       Is used frequency to regenerate other data?

GetAdjacency - Mengfei's thing? Get rid of it?

MIPS - Straight copy of DB.

MajorityVote_prep - ???

Mint - First PPI network. Not really used any more.
       Conventions and organization is similar to Biogrid directory.
